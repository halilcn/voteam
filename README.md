## What is voteam?
voteam helps you make decisions within any team. What does it mean ?

Let's explain. Various types of voting can be initiated within voteam.net.
Each team member votes. But each member's vote is of different strength.
Each member's strength is determined by a monthly power vote.
No one knows the power of another member. These include the leader.
Everything is secret. All members can see the result of voting when voting is over.
The result of the voting is determined by algorithms.
